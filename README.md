# Website Lá Cải Vnexpress
This is the 4th project in the Python Mega Course on Udemy. I created a light-weighted website to read articles on vnexpress.com. I just wanted to get infomation in some specific categories so I didn't include every topic on the original page. Though both the CSS and JS parts are virtually not good (There are bugs in loading and scaling images), I learnt a lot of new things along the way. I realized how little I know about technologies surounding me (For example, F12 button in Chrome is awesome) and how much I need to learn in the future. This project took longer than I had expected but it was a priceless oppotunity to sharpen my coding skill and I wouldn't trade anything for that.
